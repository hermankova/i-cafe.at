We are a small café in Grödig near Salzburg, serving a variety of freshly made-in-house sandwiches, cakes, desserts and the best coffee. All sandwiches can be adapted to your wishes and preferences, for example as a vegan variant.

You can enjoy your meal directly in our café or let it prepare to go, so you can arrive just in time for the important business meeting or departure of the Untersberg cable car. Or maybe you can meet your colleagues, friends or family here, start the day with a healthy breakfast and then continue with your plans.  

## Opening times
Mon-Fri 6:00am-4:00pm.
